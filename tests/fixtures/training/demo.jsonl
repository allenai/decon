{"text": "Welcome to RISC questions blog. A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations.\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC? 7. The end"}
{"text": "Kenneth has created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds? To the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, bringing the weight to 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pounds.\nNext, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 pounds.\nAnd finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, to a final weight of 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 pounds.\n#### 16"}
